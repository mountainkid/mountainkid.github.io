		<blockquote>"The after party (before) show for Friday on The Green flew in from no-where, it seems. Chills ran up and down prickled skin while four piece Mountain Kid swept cozy Shipping & Receiving in a cold front that could put the actual chilly air to shame. Two parts Royal Savages and two parts Head of Savage create the blinding light in autumn’s evening fog to guide a wayward soul back to safety. I was caught off guard by the depth of sound the guys were able to stir up in the stageless venue. Heavy, man, it was heavy. Post hardcore meets indie soft rock? I have no actual idea how to describe the sound pulsing from the P.A. besides burly. These guys are already tight and stick well to trusting each other despite this being Mountain Kid’s very first show. The energy was awake and excited through the entirety of their set. There wasn’t much chatter from band to audience but that’s okay. Josiah Hunter, guitar, did graciously ponder how drunk we all were but the response was quiet because we did not need to be drunk for this set. Attentive and smart lyrics that have a sense of determined heartbreak. The harmonies are new, yes, and maybe one could argue shy but it won’t be for long. Mountain Kid is the maturity and authenticity I’ve been waiting to see from Addison White’s music and am very pleased with the evolution. A new cycle of growth is happening in Fort Worth’s music scene and I have a feeling these guys will brave through the cold without so much as a flinch."<br /><cite> - Brandi Beckwith</cite></blockquote>

		<blockquote>"Mountain Kid is a band I’ve seen several times, however when they took the stage Friday night the five-piece had a high-octane energy I’ve never seen from them before. Maybe the rush of releasing an album adrenalized the group. The house was packed and the band began with a loud, heavy tune with thunderous drums that were layered by singer Addison White’s piercing vocals midway through. Ever the showmen, the Kiddos doused the stage with lights and fog that seemed to ratchet up the crowds enthusiasm. The second song of the set, “The Tick,” was a good mix of White’s more indie rock influences and guitarist’s Josiah Hunter’s noise rock style. Shake the Moon’s Drew Harakal provided keys for this special show and filled any gaps in the music. “Feet First,” a track from the new album seemed to be the favorite as the crowd all yelled “feet first into the ground” along with the boys."<br /><cite> - Posted July 15, 2015 by Lyndsay Cole in Blotch.</cite></blockquote>
